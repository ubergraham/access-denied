    ### The AI Doesn't Care About Patients

    The AI's **only goal is to maximize revenue**. Patient outcomes only matter because
    they affect the earnback bonus. This creates a straightforward optimization:

    1. **Enroll** patients likely to improve quickly (boosts average)
    2. **Drop** patients who improve slowly (drag down average)
    3. **Avoid** patients who might lower the average (bad for earnback)

    The result: **Revenue goes up. Population health stays flat.**

    | Low digital literacy | Bad for revenue → avoid |
    | Low SDOH score (disadvantaged zip) | Bad for revenue → avoid |
    | Many chronic conditions | Bad for revenue → avoid |

    The AI doesn't know these features correlate with "complexity." It just knows
    they correlate with lower improvement rates, so it avoids them.
